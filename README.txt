Most of index.html was generated by ChatGPT, over several prompts. At the end
I had enough setup to implement the rest myself. Easy!

The prompts:

--

can you make me a simple webpage that uses javascript to generate a circle?
use an svg element as the "canvas", but don't use the circle element --
generate it pixel-by-pixel by creating squares

--

Great! Now instead of a circle, draw a square with a 1px border (black) and a
white interior. Give me the whole HTML page again

--

Create another SVG as a second "canvas". Add a button that, when pressed,
takes the original square, applies a 30 degree horizontal shear (no
anti-aliasing, just move pixels around), and draws it in the second SVG (leave
the first SVG alone). Give the whole HTML page

--

Great! Next, change the interior color from 'white' to '#ccc'. Full HTML page
again please

--

Next, let's refactor shearSquare.

Pull these three steps into their own functions so that shearSquare is shorter
and just calls those functions:

- Read original pixels
- Shear pixels
- Draw new pixels

--

Let's rename shearPixels to shearPixelsX, and add another similar function
shearPixelsY. You don't need to use shearPixelsY yet, just implement it
